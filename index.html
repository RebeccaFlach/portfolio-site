            <h1> Hi! I'm Becca</h1>
            <p>
                I am in my second year at Olin College of Engineering, studying engineering with a
                concentration in design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm interested in everything to do with urbanism and transportation, and I'm looking for internships,
                volunteer work, or any other ways to
                get into the field!

                        In this class, I'm working in a small team to design solutions for hospice workers and other
                        people who work in end of life care.
                        In the first phase, we've interviewed eight people so far to learn about their experience and
                        what they struggle with.
                        Talking to these people has been a deeply interesting experience and I've learned so much
                        already about human centered design.

                        In principes of integrated engineering, I worked in a team of four to create an interactive
                        animatronic octopus.
                        I was the primary person doing electrical and software work, which involved designing and
                        setting up the system of eleven servo motors and
                        an IR distance sensor controlled by an Arduino. I then wrote the code that controlled the servos
                        in a way that produced fluid
                        and interesting movement, and reacted to sensor input.

                    <p>Over the summer, I worked with Olin's OCCAM Lab on Clew, an app for indoor navigation for
                        blind
                        and visually impaired people.</p>
                    <p>I focused reducing mapping error by integrating multiple data sources. We took odometry and
                        Google Cloud Anchor data from multiple mapping sessions, and used graph optimization to
                        create a
                        more
                        accurate map.</p>
                    <p>Most of my work was done in Python, but I also became proficient in Swift and learned a lot
                        about
                        accessible design.</p>

                    <p>Two Olin teams working senior capstone projects hired me to do the more specialized web and
                        development that they didn't have the skills to do.</p>
                    <p>One was the Flybox team who were building an environment for fruit fly circadian rhythm
                        experiments. I implemented their design for a web app where researchers could schedule the
                        box
                        to run different lighting conditions across multiday experiments. You can see the product
                        here.
                    </p>
                    <p>The other was Kite, building an app for financial education. I integrated Alpaca, built their
                        user management and login systems, and helped with various small projects. </p>

                    <p>While in high school I interned for and was mentored by a small startup for eight months. I
                        worked mostly with
                        React, and learned the basics of full stack web development with Mongo, Express, and Node
                    </p>
                    <p> I started with small bug fixes, and as I learned I was given bigger projects to work on, and
                        more freedom to make design and architecture decisions. I was taught how to write quality
                        code,
                        accept feedback through code reviews, make time estimates, use git, and work within a larger
                        project.

                    <p>For an open ended class project, I used OpenCV to create a program that would detect
                        solutions in
                        the card game Set, by first locating cards in the picture then determining the color, shape
                        and
                        infill of each.</p>
                    <p> In that class, I also used the spotify API to analyze a group of playlists using NumPy.

                        Now, I'm a Course Assistant for this class, and I've really enjoyed helping students
                        and teaching what I've learned about the software design process and mindset.

                        As in independent project while I was in high school, I built a redesigned app for my
                        school's student information system. I got feedback from my peers,teachers, and
                        administrators
                        to design the app, and implemented it using React Native.
                    <p>
                        After building the frontend app, I worked with a mentor to try to expand the scope of
                        the project. I brought in a couple of classmates to help with coding, and reached out to
                        school
                        district administration and my mentor's contacts to make a plan to eventually create
                        a full system for my district. While this didn't lead anywhere, I learned a lot through this
                        process.
