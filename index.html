                <p>I'm an aspiring engineer, maker, and urbanist.
                    I'm currently a junior at Olin College of Engineering, studying mechanical engineering. I hope to
                    apply my skills in engineering and human centered design
                    to help build more sustainable, equitable, and enjoyable cities. I am especially interested in
                    transportation and housing.
                    I have experience and skills in coding, mechanical engineering, human centered design, and urbanism
                    research. </p>

                        <p>I focused reducing mapping error by integrating multiple data sources. We took odometry and
                            Google Cloud Anchor data from multiple mapping sessions, and used graph optimization to
                            create a

                        <p>Most of my work was done in Python, and I also became proficient in Swift and learned a lot

                            Using R, we combined census demographic data with MBTA ridership and location data to
                            analyze access to the T. Although it was a simplistic approach that missed much of the
                            nuance of equity issues, I learned a lot about Boston and issues with the T.

                        <p>For the Flybox team, I implemented their design for an experiment automation web app.
                            The site was built with React based on Figma design documents, and revised based on
                            stakeholder feedback.

                        <p>The other was Kite, building an app for financial education. Working in React Native,
                            I set up an OAuth authentication flow, implemented other smaller systems as needed,
                            and advised on other technical aspects of the project.</p>

                            more freedom to make design and architecture decisions. I was taught how to write quality
                            code,
                            accept feedback through code reviews, make time estimates, use git, and work within a larger

                            As in independent project while I was in high school, I built a redesigned app for my
                            school's student information system. I got feedback from my peers,teachers, and
                            administrators
                            to design the app, and implemented it using React Native.
                        <p>
                            After building the frontend app, I worked with a mentor to try to expand the scope of
                            the project. I brought in a couple of classmates to help with coding, and reached out to
                            school
                            district administration and my mentor's contacts to make a plan to eventually create
                            a full system for my district. While this didn't lead anywhere, I learned a lot through this
                            process.

                            In Olin's combat robotics group, CRoG, I worked with a small team to design and build
                            a three pound robot to fight against other bots at an NHRL tournament.
                            This process involved conceptual design, CAD, electronic design, manufacturing, and
                            assembly.
                            I improved my Solidworks skills, mechanical intuition, understanding of electronic systems,
                            and machining abilities. I also learned to think on my feet, coming up with creative fixes
                            under tight time constraints between rounds at the tournament.
                            Now, I am a co-president club and help support and advise three teams of builders.

                            In principes of integrated engineering, I worked in a team of four to create an interactive
                            animatronic octopus.
                            I was the primary person doing electrical and software work, which involved designing and
                            setting up the system of eleven servo motors and
                            an IR distance sensor controlled by an Arduino. I then wrote the code that controlled the
                            servos
                            in a way that produced fluid
                            and interesting movement, and reacted to sensor input.
                            I also contributed to mechanical design by designing the sensor housing.

                        <p>For a recent class I took, Urban Sociology and Policy, I wrote an essay examining pedestrian
                            safety in my
                            hometown of Tucson, Arizona. I found that the city's poor pedestrian safety record is the
                            result
                            of the
                            design of the roads and lack of pedestrian infrastructure, which in turn is a result of
                            historical
                            planning decisions and current policy priorities and culture. I learned a lot about the

                            people who work in end of life care.
                            In the first phase, we interviewed ten people to learn about their experience in the field
                            and what issues they face.
                            In the second phase, we took synthesized our learnings, conducted further interviews and
                            co-design sessions, and created a proposal for a education program for families to help
                            change cultural views of death and hospice.
